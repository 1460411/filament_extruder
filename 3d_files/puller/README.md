# Puller

**Note:** This is a first prototype of the puller and a work in progress. 

The **puller** is a subsystem of the filament extruder line that hauls off the solidified filament coming out of the extruder at a controlled speed.

## Parts

The parts necessary for building one puller (first prototype) are:

* 1 `puller_structure_simplified_fixed` (printed part)
* 1 `puller_lever_with_spring` (printed part)
* 1 `puller_wheel` (printed part)
* 1 continuous rotation servo (I use this one: http://www.pololu.com/product/1248)
* 1 625-2RS radial ball bearing
* 1 spring
* 5 M3x16 screws
* 1 M3x20 screw
* 5 M3 nuts
* 1 M3 self-locking nut
* 13 M3 washers
* Optional: 2 M5x10 screws and 2 t-nuts are necessary for fixing the puller to a v-slot profile.
